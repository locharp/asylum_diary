I am arrested again after writing https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/blob/main/state/past%20and%20present.md yesterday.\

I was sitting in King's Cross Station using my phone. Some staff approached. I answered some questions about the signs on my belongings, which were about the persecution I am facing. The staff left. The British Transport Police came. They checked some scratches on the floor where I was sitting and asked for my ID. I replied that they had stolen it. They wrote something on some papers, moved a bit away, then came and showed me a message. When I was trying to take a picture of the message on their phone, my phone was taken. And then I was arrested.

During the process, I was handcuffed the whole time, although I didn't do anything, searched thoroughly twice, during which my whole body, including my crotch touched. Apparently, my belongings were also searched.

My request to see a solicitor was denied again. They said I denied myself when the solicitor called. And then forced me to leave the custody. It's not unlike last year when they unlawfully arrested me. This time, I received notices that say I am on immigration bail and about the withdrawal of implied permission to use the. Do readers remember why I have to live on the street?
