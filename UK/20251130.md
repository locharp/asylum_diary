I am arrested again after writing https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/blob/main/state/past%20and%20present.md yesterday.\

During the process, I was handcuffed the whole time, although I didn't do anything, searched thoroughly twice, during which my whole body, including my crotch touched.

My request to see a solicitor was denied again. They say I denied myself when the solicitor called. and then forced me to leave the custody. It's not unlike last year when they unlawfully arrested me. This time, I received notices that say I am on immigration bail and about the withdrawal of implied permission to use the. Do readers remember why I have to live on the street?
