I am currently an asylum seeker in the UK. But the situation has led me to believe that the authorities of the UK, like the authorities of Lithuania, are working with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

I am not asking for direct help, but I hope that you can find out what happened since I applied for asylum in Lithuania or attempted to volunteer for Ukraine in Poland. I am not able to do that myself. Maybe one day, what you find out will be meaningful.

Currently, they have stolen almost everything from me. I stay alive on the street basically under their arrangement while being monitored and restricted both physically and digitally in a way that’s not obvious to people on the street.

A life that doesn’t even remotely resemble a normal one, let alone doing anything meaningful.

My situation is generally unsafe. They would and had pushed it to life-threatening danger to invalidate it, despite I had said that’s not the kind of safety I was talking about.

Physical safety, I had been assaulted, and I absolutely cannot get help from the authorities. In fact, the authorities arrested me after one of the assaults to protect the perpetrators.

Digital safety, I have been under extreme surveillance that monitors me both physically and digitally, including my sleeping area and bathroom. My network is controlled. Both my physical and digital mail can be intercepted.

Property safety, I have long been aware that I can’t really do anything or own anything safely, both physical and digital. The latest theft that stole almost everything from me is proof. The incident about the bicycle I bought for commuting was another. It also showed that they didn’t care what serious consequences they could have caused when I was the one to suffer them.

Initially, the CCP believed that humans were to be manipulated, and believed that the asylum process was the perfect opportunity. Lithuania, given what happened, I can only arrive at this conclusion: agreed and helped.

The UK most likely also saw the same and helped them. They probably already committed some extra crimes back in Lithuania. And the solution they decided to employ is doubling down. As if going even further in the UK would justify what they did in Lithuania.

becameAs the situation dragged on and they had committed more and more crimes. It became a self-reinforcing behaviour.

I believe the CCP, Lithuania, and the UK have together committed more crimes than just what they have been doing to me directly.

They probably have other narratives for the situation. One of the things they seem to be doing is to ridicule the whole situation, and a lot of people are buying. Otherwise, I won’t know how to justify their remaining silence or worse, participating in ridiculing and normalising the harassment, which in turn seems to be enough to justify the worse parts of the persecution for them.

To be honest, I think that you would trust the authorities of Lithuania and the UK over me. I can only hope that you can check my entries at https://github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary/. It should refute most of the accusations they might use to justify the crimes they have committed against me, although some might not be very obvious, and some might not be recorded, either.

They clearly know they are committing crimes against me. Take their stalking and camera aiming for example. They clearly feel that it's a problem when I started recording in return. Some of the other crimes were more or less stemmed from it. So why don't they have  a problem when they have been doing it for years?

They also have said things like, “want revenge?” and “refugee?” in a mocking tone. The way they said “refugee” was as if I should have accepted what they had done to me if I was really a refugee. That’s mindblowing given what they had been doing. Some examples are:

Throughout the years of the asylum process, I have received barely any documents or information from them, and even less was genuine. You will be able to find in the latter entries that they literally deny me basic rights, with which information was also denied. With information withheld, I have been treated arbitrarily, to say the least.

They have repeatedly damaged my health. My respiratory system is severely weakened and hasn’t been able to recover.

They have been drugging and molesting me. Degrees vary; the length spans years.

I believe what they have been doing to me is serious enough to be called crimes against humanity.

I feel quite sure, after suffering the past years of persecution facilitated by Lithuania and the UK, that the email address I was given at the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw was fake. It was a Gmail, likely created by my original persecutors. Does it mean Poland or Ukraine was also working with the CCP?

I assure you that I was completely cooperative, had the interest of the host countries in mind, and appreciated even the smallest things when I applied for asylum in Lithuania. There were doubts since the beginning, but I thought most of them were caused by the CCP, and others were just imperfections. I waited and hoped that Lithuania would decide that helping the CCP was wrong.

I stopped cutting my hair when I sensed something was wrong in the early summer of 2022, and started writing on GitHub things that seemed out of place.

I also started using an ID, Lochard Partrick, which sounds like a very offensive term in my language—Cantonese—for a very idiotic person around that time. I hoped that the Lithuanians could see that I was deeply troubled and stop what was happening, whether because it was a joke that should stop, or because a realisation of how wrong it’s to help the CCP. It didn’t happen.

6 months became 10, 10 months became 1 year, and at the end, when I left Lithuania, it was 22 months. No information, but non-stop harassment. The harassment, humiliations, and health damages just couldn’t be justified.

From LLM, it seems that one of the things they have been doing to me is called “Double Bind”.
