New pains, probably mean new damages.

Found something hideous. Not that hideous is new.

An incomplete record of what happened tonight. (after 12 a.m. of 28 Jul 2025)
Woke up by effects on my body at midnight, it was not a new thing already. There was also a faint smell in the air, also not new. A "housemate", or live-in persecutor, "returns" from outside when I went downstair to the kitchen. Later, I realised there were strange noises from outside, it may sound surprising but this wasn't new either. Found that one of the noises came from a car in the car park the window of my room faces. A "neighbour", or persecutor next door, came out from the house to the car. The car moved away and back. The persecutor yelled at me. He then climbed up the roof and came to my window. I stepped back from the window and he shut the window forcefully. He continued to talk in a terrorizing voice at me. He was also on his phone. A few objects were thrown at my window.

Note: I am not calling them persecutors only because of this event. I mentioned before about the absurd number of the persecutor group.

Although this can be deduced and it applies to other events, perhaps I should write it explicitly for readers. This happened under surveillance. It applies to applies other events, whether I recorded in the entries or not.

Same plays, same crimes, same shamelessness.
