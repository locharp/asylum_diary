2.5 months since the authorities and foreign persecutors stole my belongings and made me live on the street.

They are intentionally pushing me into homelessness. Instead of giving me back my belongings, they are making me live on charities and supports for the homeless.

Like everywhere else, they have influence over those organisations and networks.

They still molest me, or more boardly, put me under effects with devices and drugs after stealing my belongings and making me live on the street.
