Civil societies die so easily that it's like dominoes.

Wherever I go, every person, every organisation has decided what to say and what to do before I even arrive.

Of course, I know the authorities can always tell them something and have them act the way they instruct. With the extreme surveillance, they can also see where I am going and arrive before I do.

The disappointment, however, has gone from collusion between governments to mass madness, from bad institutions to general loss of values among people. The horror of the latter is far worse than the former in my opinion.

I know I have talked about this long ago. But I guess it still pushes me towards deeper despair every day.

If the people who took side with the persecutors before were just acting on a single occasion, the people now are doing it long term.

I have tried to evoke what I believed to be in the brighter side of human nature. I have always been harsh while looking at human as a whole. Yet, all the grim impressions and views I have can't protect me from disappointment that turns into despair.

Since my persecutors have gone so far that they unlawfully arrested me and falsely accuse me, I should add that I have always been nice to people in contrast to my pessimistic views for human as a whole. The persecutors know and exploit it time and again in disgusting ways. In fact, I will say that the fact I was nice to everyone was a reason why their “baby, hehehe” mentality has gone insane. And sadly, the people joining them are probably the same.
I can understand that as the first response while being told a narrative by the authorities. But it is far more than that. It has been months since the persecutors stole my belongings and made me live on the street. I have been forced to live on the food and materials from charities.
People might think that “we are just doing it this particular occasion”. But does it work simple that way?

Back in Lithuania I already said things would only get worse because of their mentality. Look at the situation today, was I wrong? I am not even smart with people, but people will hate those they have hurt, and conformity gets people to join in something they shouldn't. The authorities being part of the persecutor group only makes it worse. A group with powers to abuse and enjoy impunity will likely snowball into something bigger. Tendencies like these turned out to be reality, haven’t they?
