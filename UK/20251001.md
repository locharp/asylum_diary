3 weeks already, my property is still not returned to me. Still getting the same bullshit again and again like in the past 3.5 years.

Harassment, humiliation, further theft attempt, health problems accumulated from having to live on the street, I dare say at the end no body will take responsibility of any of these. In fact, I believe even now there are those fake cough like it's funny.

This world is doubtlessly full of sf. So many that I am doubthing how the common, or less sick, people have to live as the sickness get worse. I still haven't adjust meaningfully to cope with the sickness I come to understand in recent years. Nor am I sure that I could ever.
