It has been a while since I wrote the last post. Currently, the 43rd month of being treated as non-human. The situation hasn’t got better. Kind of expected long ago, I mean, look at the situation... but it still hurts further when it happens. 7 weeks ago, my belongings were stolen, and I have been made to live on the street since.

I don’t prefer using the word homeless, partly because I think there is a good chance the persecutors are getting off on it, but also because I have been homeless for a long time, in a sense.

Not much has changed if you look at it from the perspective that my life as a human had been taken away long ago. But I think it is still getting worse. For example, I can’t even study or surf the net much. Every day, hours are spent walking between places like charity kitchens, libraries, and train stations. And then, another hours are lost due to constantly falling asleep, which is definitely abnormal.

Oh, yes, I am still studying, more or less, which my instinct tells me is a mistake because the persecutors will see it as a sign for them to continue their torture. And to be honest, there isn’t really much of a reason for me to continue studying. The persecutors probably are not thinking the same way. As for why I am still doing so, it’s better left unspoken, lest I further trigger the sickness of the persecutors. Although if you have read before, you might remember that there is literally no way not to trigger them.

There is a question I have been thinking about for a long time: What is left that I can do in a situation like mine? What can I do that can help, or at least not cause harm, when everything I do can get cancerised before it can reach anyone?

The only thing that has come to mind is to stand by what I decided to stand by. I hoped that I could do more, but you can read from my writing that I can’t even protect myself. Not materially, nor immaterially. Not my property, nor my dignity. So, do not do in your countries what I wouldn’t have done in mine (sadly, if things went well, there shouldn’t be this distinction) is perhaps the best I can manage. I am still trying hard to maintain it. I hope that when I can’t do anything really tangibly beneficial, at least you can see that I have not come overseas just to bow to power abuse in your countries. Though I have to say, whether the past 2 months in Camden or the previous year in Stevenage, I haven’t seen you normal people.

For those who think that I am causing trouble or inviting trouble for myself, but haven’t completely lost your humanity, think again about what you think that I should have done in response to power abuses, drugging, molestation, health damage, etc. But, more importantly, do you really know enough to judge in the first place? You join them in such circumstances?

Whatever reason they think or claim they have, I dare say here again: I came as a person who needed help, but I also came with the best intentions.

If you, who are reading this, are normal people as opposed to the persecutors, you should worry about how many of your kind are left in the current world. I used to think there are more people with core values that they will say no to power abuse or wrong things in general at some point than people without, in other words, there are lines they will not cross. That's not the case. Or if that's, I don't know where those lines are, and I don't know if it's any better.

With that in mind, you should worry about what chance we have of not spiraling down this path. It’s already doubtful today that we still have a chance to steer societies toward better accountability and checks and balances. With “people” falling into line without questioning much as soon as the “authorities” speak, I am afraid we don’t really get to talk about “we, the people” anymore.  Let alone making any changes.
