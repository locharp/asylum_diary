Wrote some messages recently. I guess I might as well put them here for readers.

I am writing with all seriousness knowing that they will see this.

It would be the best if you can read the entries I wrote over the years at github.com/locharp/asylum_diary.

I am the one who can only read and dined at your basement. I guess you might believe it's me being problematic. I can only try to write a few things to get you think critically.

1. Why would an asylum seeker speak ill of the authorities of the host country? You can say I am stupid to do this. But having lost my mind? I hope I have.
2. Your authorities and foreign persecutors have gone out of their way to do many things since the beginning. Here is a few of them:
2a. Damage my health again and again.
2b. Daily stalking, harassment, privacy violation, communication interception.
2c. Countless times of humiliation and insult
2d. Drugging
2e. Molestation

I don't expect you to be on my side. But I hope you can look at the matter seriously. And let more people know and think. I won't be too surprised to find it ends up means an even more misery fate for me.
