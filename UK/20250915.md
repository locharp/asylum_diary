Another hundreds.

2 years ago I said things were bad, but it probably would't end the way the persecutors expected. They continued. And then they decided that I was the one making troubles, although I had done little but suffered their sickness everyday.

It is repeating now, with the exception that I clearly expressed how sick they are.

But seriously, am I even capable to do that? How sick do one has to be to treat a human as a toy, an animal, some manipulatable object you own for years?

The most terrifying part still is how easily a huge number of people join in. I don't know what they are told.

I thought I was a huge critic of  my own species. Now I doubt if I understood even a quarter of the dark side of our species.

Another article about Lucifer Effect. I guess it is better than referring to my own writing.\
