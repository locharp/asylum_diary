If I stop updating for a prolonged period, it’s likely that I end up suffering worse.

If my narrative changes, it’s likely that I end up suffering worse.



I am trying to highlight some of the important points about the years-long persecution I am still facing. But for a fuller—yet incomplete—record, please check the entries on github.com/locharp/asylum_diary.



You will find that I used strong words here and there, but even the strongest terms cannot reflect the severity of the crimes I have been suffering.

I have no doubt there are greater sufferings in this world, but it doesn’t make mine less serious.

If you find it crazy and unbelievable, you are probably getting the right idea of what has been happening.

I want readers to know I was conscious of being a refugee and kept the interests of the host countries in mind, was nice to everyone, from the authorities to the possibly illegal migrants, and appreciated even the smallest things. Hell, I even considered dying while volunteering for Ukraine to be acceptable.

But the persecutors are utterly sick. Everything is a tool to them. Goodwill, or anything innocent for that matter, gets calculated and used. The considerations mentioned above are just some examples.

I tried hard to protect the possible evidence to support my case; they made it hard, impossible even, for me to do so.

I tried hard to protect myself; they abused power, committed crimes to make sure I couldn’t.

I tried to give the best of myself. In return, I got years of humiliation and torture.

They went out of their way to do that, and they are still continuing.

Call me whatever you want. I don’t find it acceptable. In fact, even they know they are committing crimes.

You don’t need to take my word for it, but I hope that you will question theirs, too. Especially beware of reverse causality.

You will find it easy to believe them, given many factors, such as:

* They have absurd numbers spanning across all sorts of sectors.
* Their status, power, and perhaps even reputation.
* Their ability to collect or create materials to fit their narratives.
* They might be better persuaders, too, especially to unsuspecting people.

I left my home city when I sensed danger there.

Tried to volunteer for Ukraine, having considered my lack of experience and the risk which I considered death was possible.

Applied for asylum in Lithuania after receiving no response from the email address of a supposed volunteer organisation.

Slowly felt that I was not only monitored both inside and outside of the centre, but also relived persecution, faced privacy violation, harassment, intimidation, humiliation, insults, health damage, etc.

Had a hard time getting any information as the progress dragged on and on.

Left Lithuania after getting back my expiring passport after having contacted the migration department for months.

Trapped and robbed at RIX, Latvia.

Arrived in the UK with barely any money left.

I dare say that Lithuania helped the persecutors foreign to Lithuania do whatever they want to me, and the UK is helping persecutors foreign to the UK do whatever they want to me. Help might not be the best word here since their deep involvement.

There is little doubt that what they have been doing to me are serious crimes. What remains to be found out is how many of their crimes have gone unnoticed and unmentioned by me. It’s very likely there are more than I have voiced my worries about.
