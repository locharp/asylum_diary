### Charing Cross Library
The computer logged out after 1 
hour use and says the reservation 
is not paid for when I tried to login again.
 
I know there is a time limit, but 
it wasn't 1  hour and it didn't 
say something about payment afterward.

Is there some kind of mis-configuration?






I can only read.
Could you send the reply 
to my email address please?






I can only read. I don't
 know what are saying.








Let's be frank. I want to let 
you know something. The problem 
happened for earlier than just
 today.
 
you probably won't admit, but 
I have been persecuted for
years already.

Regardless, there is something 
you should know as a citizen,
who should know what the 
authorities do and keep 
them in check.

Do you know your authorities
and foreign persecutors stole 
my belongings including my 
laptops?

Before that they had already 
committed an array of crimes
against me. Including but 
not limited to:
permanent health damages
stalking
drugging
molestation
assault
unlawful arrest
false accusation
