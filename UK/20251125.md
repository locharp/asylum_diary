44th month of deprivation of information and human identity, insult, molestation, permanent health damages, false accusations, and more by the Chinese Communist Party, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom.

2.5 months since the authorities and foreign persecutors have stolen my belongings and made me live on the street.

They are intentionally pushing me fully into homelessness. Instead of giving me back my belongings they have stolen, they are making me live on charities and supports for the homeless.

Like everywhere else, they have influence over those organisations and networks.

They still molest me, or more boardly, put me under effects with devices and drugs, after stealing my belongings and making me live on the street.
