When I applied for asylum in Lithuania, I asked them to check my devices for potential evidence. They refused. I also let them check my belongings on some occasions. For unknown reasons, they had to secretly search my room and my belongings afterward.\
When I applied for asylum in the UK, I also asked them to check my devices. They refused. For unknown reasons, they had to make up fake "rules" to keep my belongings here and there. Later, they even used criminal methods to take my belongings, including my devices.

If I am not mistaken, both Lithuania and the UK facilitated the foreign persecutors' impersonation and let them use fake identities to humiliate and hurt me. It includes letting them handle my asylum case and shape their narrative. One of the things is choosing what to beb talked about so that only what they want is talked about.\
I tried to contact the Home Office directly, but they refused. On some occasions, I asked the police to help. Not only did they not help, they intimidated me. Later even unlawfully arrested me and arranged assaults and arrested me again. And now they have stolen my belongings to make me live on the street and get food and clothes from the charities, creating opportunities for them to humiliate and hurt me at their whims.

The day after writing this entry, I was arrested again: https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/blob/main/UK/20251130.md. My request to see a solicitor once again denyied. This time I was forced to leave the custody.

In the past 43 months, I have received barely any genuine documents or letters. The same goes for verbal communication. I think it's safe (not in the sense that I won't get hurt) to say that they are faking an asylum process to create an environment for the foreign persecutors to humiliate me, hurt me, and find ways to discredit my claim about their persecution. Now it extends to undermining me as a person since more and more crimes are committed by not only my original persecutors, but also the "asylums".

I think my current situation is not much different from being falsely imprisoned, just like in Lithuania, for humiliation and harm, and covering up crimes, but worse. It's not much different from being kept as an animal.

Their original plan years ago, although still sickeningly meant to treat a human as an animal or an object for manipulation, was probably less blatant and inhumane. But as more and more crimes have been committed, they have shifted more and more towards plain power abuses, condition manipulation by substances and devices, and harm.

Before my belongings were stolen, I was often put to sleep during the day and tormented at night at they supposed asylum accommodation.

When I say treated as an animal, it's, of course, just a figure of speech. I don't treat animals the way they treat me.
