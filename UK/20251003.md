A girl approached me on the street  appeared to be scared of a woman.

Accompanied her to a shop where there were more people

Things still looked bad.

Police and ambulance came.

She still yelled for quite a while before being taken away.

The woman said the girl is her daughter and thanked me for wanted to help and offered to let her daughter contact me to confirm 
she is fine. Left an email address to her.

Seemed that the incident should
be considered resolved and
everyone safe.

But none of the links of the event really made me feel right.
