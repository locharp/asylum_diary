If this is read by a local who is not part of the persecutor group, I hope that you can help finding out the other crimes they have committed and spread then word. Before taking action make sure there are people who will know if something happens to you.

I am not able to to that. They have control over my devices and communication. They also have the influence to make people join the persecution before they even meet me.

This is so absurd. With "baby, hehehe..." or whatever word that's magical to them they can justify all that they have been doing which are obviously serious crime.

And it is a global thing. How can this world not be a woe?

I came to King's Cross two days ago. I came by train becasue the train station and the drivers of FlixBus say they don't sell ticket.

The cough was serious, but hopefully is dying down. I felt asleep, or rather, lose consciousness, everywhere. I don't think it's normal. This is actually, like most things, nothing new. This happened a lot, e.g., when I was in the library in Stevenage.

There are increased number of stalkers and cameras. Not something to surprise about I guess.

There are a lot of things happened. None is good.

There ought to be at least some people who know what they are doing are nothing other than persecution.
